    Min-heap: (Priority Queue)
        A complete binary tree. (* Complete binary tree: completely filled other than the rightmost
        elements on the last level)
        The root being the minimum in the tree. (Max-heap opposite)

        - Insert:
            Insert at bottom rightmost spot.
            Swap till min at root.
            Runtime: O(logn)
        - Remove Min:
            Extract root.
            Replace root with bottom rightmost node.
            Bubble down and swap till min at root.
            Runtime: O(logn)
